# Persona p02 — Maya Patel

## Summary
Maya Patel is a 26-year-old second-year Internal Medicine resident at UT Health Austin. She lives alone, carries $178k in med school debt, and is managing chronic sleep deprivation, isolation, and career uncertainty around fellowship vs. hospitalist routes. She uses AI to decompress after hard shifts and is deeply aware of privacy given her medical training.

## Project Ideas by Track
**Track 1 — Memory Infrastructure:** Design a portable "personal health summary" that aggregates Maya's wearable data, schedule, and mood logs into a shareable medical record she controls.
**Track 2 — AI Companions:** Build a post-call decompression companion that reads Maya's shift log and adapts its response — offering emotional support, brief CBT prompts, or practical advice depending on what the data suggests she needs.
**Track 3 — Personal Value:** Analyze Maya's AI conversation transcripts and lifelog to generate a monthly wellbeing report — surfacing when she's most at risk of burnout and what correlates with better days.
