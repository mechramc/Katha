## Project Ideas by Track
**Track 1 — Memory Infrastructure:** Build a freelancer "business brain" that ingests client emails, invoices, and calendar data to auto-generate a weekly business summary — income, hours worked, pipeline status.
**Track 2 — AI Companions:** Create an ADHD-aware work companion that reads Theo's upcoming calendar and past productivity patterns to suggest the optimal task order and work block structure for his day.
**Track 3 — Personal Value:** Analyze Theo's AI conversation history and lifelog to build a "confidence tracker" that shows how his self-perception around pricing, worth, and skill has evolved over time.
