How do I stop doing this? ASSISTANT: Pricing anxiety is almost always the root cause. The fix isn't a rate card \u2014 it's building the muscle of saying numbers out loud before they feel comfortable. Try this: before your next proposal call, write the number on paper and say it aloud three times. Then on the call, say it and stop talking. Silence feels like rejection but it's usually just processing.

What specifically feels harder \u2014 the financial security, the social validation, the sense of a clear path? Comparison is usually pointing at something you actually want.
