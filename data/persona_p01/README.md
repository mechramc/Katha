## Project Ideas by Track
**Track 1 — Memory Infrastructure:** Build a consent-aware data vault that ingests Jordan's multi-source exports and provides a unified timeline view with privacy controls.
**Track 2 — AI Companions:** Build a weekly "life coach" agent that reviews Jordan's lifelog, calendar, and Fitbit data to surface patterns in sleep, work overload, and relationship quality — and suggests micro-interventions.
**Track 3 — Personal Value:** Analyze Jordan's AI conversation history to identify recurring anxieties, then generate a personalized "insight report" showing her growth themes and blind spots over time.
