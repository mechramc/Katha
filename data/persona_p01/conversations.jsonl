ASSISTANT: That 3am wake-up is often your brain processing incomplete loops. Try a 10-minute 'brain dump' before bed \u2014 write every open item, assign each a next action, then physically close the notebook. You're telling your brain: I've got this handled.

I don't know how to fix it without fixing work first. ASSISTANT: The problem is that 'fix work first' is a moving target \u2014 there'll always be another quarter, another launch.

ASSISTANT: Burnout isn't always dramatic. Watch for: cynicism toward work that used to matter to you, reduced efficacy on tasks you're normally good at, emotional exhaustion that doesn't improve after rest, and physical symptoms like recurring headaches or getting sick more often.

ASSISTANT: The most common killer is starting too fast. Your aerobic system needs weeks to catch up to your ambition. Try the 'run/walk' method: 1 min run, 2 min walk, 20 minutes total, 3x per week for the first month. You should be able to hold a conversation while running. If you can't, slow down.

ASSISTANT: Start with the 28/36 rule: your housing payment shouldn't exceed 28% of gross monthly income, and total debt payments shouldn't exceed 36%. With your combined income you'd want to model different down payment scenarios. Beyond price, factor in property tax (Texas is high), HOA if applicable, maintenance buffer (1-2% of home value annually), and how long you plan to stay \u2014 buying makes less sense under 5 years typically.

ASSISTANT: Saying no is a skill, not a personality trait. The easiest starting move: don't answer immediately. 'Let me check my capacity and get back to you' buys you space to decide intentionally. Next, get clear on your top 3 priorities \u2014 anything outside them needs a compelling reason.
