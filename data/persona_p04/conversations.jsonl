(2) Core concept \u2014 Pauling scale, what electronegativity predicts about bond polarity. (3) Application \u2014 connect to real molecules: water, CO2, HF.

What should I even look at? ASSISTANT: First, check your allocation \u2014 many teachers end up in overly conservative portfolios that underperform over 20+ years. With 7 years to retirement, you still have meaningful time for growth. Second, review your contribution rate \u2014 even a 1-2% increase compounds significantly.
