## Project Ideas by Track
**Track 1 — Memory Infrastructure:** Design a simple, privacy-first data export tool designed for non-technical users — with a clear consent dashboard showing exactly what data is used, stored, and for how long.
**Track 2 — AI Companions:** Build a "retirement readiness" companion that synthesizes Sunita's TRS statements, spending patterns, and family obligations into a plain-language monthly snapshot.
**Track 3 — Personal Value:** Analyze Sunita's 22 years of teaching patterns (calendar, email, lesson files) to surface her most effective lesson approaches and generate a "teaching memoir" artifact she can keep.
