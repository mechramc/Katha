They're a good person but not performing. How do I do this without destroying myself? ASSISTANT: This is one of the hardest things founders face, especially when loyalty is involved. A few truths: keeping someone in the wrong role isn't kindness \u2014 it delays their growth too. Prepare the key message clearly: specific performance gaps, what support was offered, the decision.

If you're winning every deal, you're underpriced. Questions to test: are clients asking for discounts? Do they express surprise at the value vs. cost after?
