## Project Ideas by Track
**Track 1 — Memory Infrastructure:** Build a "founder brain" vault that organizes Darius's scattered AI conversations, meeting notes, and email threads into a searchable knowledge base he owns and can take with him.
**Track 2 — AI Companions:** Create a weekly co-pilot that reviews Darius's Whoop data, calendar density, and lifelog to flag when he's heading into a burnout cycle and surfaces what helped in the past.
**Track 3 — Personal Value:** Analyze Darius's AI conversation history to extract emerging themes in his book manuscript and generate an outline from his own thinking.
